# sifter 
python code to search the MPC's (Minor Planet Center's) ITF (isolated tracklet file) 

# pre-calculation 
background pre-calculations need to be performed on tracklets to facilitate rapid querying 

# search / query  
the ITF is searched by providing an input orbit, which is then checked against the ITF to see whether it is sufficiently "close" to any tracklets in the ITF
